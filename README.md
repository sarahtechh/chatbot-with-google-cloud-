## Steps I Took
1. Create a Google Cloud account
3. Created a cloud storage bucket to feed the data for South Korea travel itineraries.
4. Added the data that I would like to train the chatbot. 
5. Activated the Vertex Agent AI Agent Builder API and create a new app
6. After naming the chatbot I chose a datastore to connect to based on the cloud storage data
7. Checked the datastore to see if the data training is done 
8. Opened Dialogflow to set the chatbot up and changed the settings (ie some intents, custom payloads, css and generative fallback)
9. Test The Chatbot and enable the API to add to a website with some css variations
10. Created a simple travel front page with HTML and CSS with the ide VSCODE
11 Start using the chatbot to plan a trip to South Korea!!
